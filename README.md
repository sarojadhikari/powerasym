# Power Asymmetry from non-Gaussian Modulation #

This project contains the code necessary to produce some of the numerical results in the paper arXiv:150x.xxxxx

The basic idea is very simple: generate a large number of CMB maps with the Sachs Wolfe spectrum. Then, assume local type non-Gaussianity and generate non-Gaussian maps. This couples the small scale power spectrum with the background dipole and one therefore gets a power asymmetry whose strength depends on (i) the strength of the non-linearity (fNL, gNL), and (ii) the magnitude of the background dipole (which depends on the particular realization of C_1)
